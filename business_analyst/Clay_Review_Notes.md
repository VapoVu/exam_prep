### Review for SAS Certified Statistical Business Analyst Using SAS 9: Regression and Modeling Credential

Based in part on [the SAS page about the exam](http://support.sas.com/certify/creds/sba.html).

Exam topics include:

**ANOVA**
- Verify the assumptions of ANOVA
- Analyze differences between population means using the GLM and TTEST procedures
- Perform ANOVA post hoc test to evaluate treatment effect
- Detect and analyze interactions between factors

**Linear Regression**
- Fit a multiple linear regression model using the REG and GLM procedures
- Analyze the output of the REG procedure for multiple linear regression models
- Use the REG procedure to perform model selection
- Assess the validity of a given regression model through the use of diagnostic and residual analysis

**Logistic Regression**
- Perform logistic regression with the LOGISTIC procedure
- Optimize model performance through input selection
- Interpret the output of the LOGISTIC procedure
- Score new data sets using the LOGISTIC and SCORE procedures

**Prepare Inputs for Predictive Model Performance**
- Identify potential problems with input data
- Use the DATA step to manipulate data with loops, arrays, conditional statements and functions
- Reduce the number of categorical levels in a predictive model
- Screen variables for irrelevance using the CORR procedure
- Screen variables for non-linearity using empirical logit plots

**Measure Model Performance**
- Apply the principles of honest assessment to model performance measurement
- Assess classifier performance using the confusion matrix
- Model selection and validation using training and validation data
- Create and interpret graphs (ROC, lift, and gain charts) for model comparison and selection
- Establish effective decision cut-off values for scoring
